After Cloning the repository :
Step 1 : Create a database named book_app.
step 2 : Refer env file shared in the mail and put in the root directly.
step 3 : uncomment lines 22-29 in server.js so that migrations can run.
step 4 : Install nodemon globally to run the server

This should take care of BE part.
